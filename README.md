## Why agentmemory

AI coding agents forget everything between sessions. You explain the same architecture, re-discover the same patterns, and re-learn the same preferences every time. agentmemory fixes that.

```
Session 1: "Add auth to the API"
  Agent writes code, runs tests, fixes bugs
  agentmemory silently captures every tool use
  Session ends -> observations compressed into structured memory

Session 2: "Now add rate limiting"
  agentmemory injects context from Session 1:
    - Auth uses JWT middleware in src/middleware/auth.ts
    - Tests in test/auth.test.ts cover token validation
    - Decision: chose jose over jsonwebtoken for Edge compatibility
  Agent starts with full project awareness
```

No manual notes. No copy-pasting. The agent just *knows*.

### What it gives you

| Capability | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Automatic capture** | Every tool use, file edit, test run, and error is silently recorded via hooks |
| **LLM compression** | Raw observations are compressed into structured facts, concepts, and narratives |
| **Context injection** | Past knowledge is injected at session start within a configurable token budget |
| **Semantic search** | Hybrid BM25 + vector search finds relevant memories even with different wording |
| **Memory evolution** | Memories version over time, supersede each other, and form relationship graphs |
| **Project profiles** | Aggregated per-project intelligence: top concepts, files, conventions, common errors |
| **Auto-forgetting** | TTL expiry, contradiction detection, and importance-based eviction keep memory clean |
| **Privacy first** | API keys, secrets, and `<private>` tags are stripped before anything is stored |
| **Self-healing** | Circuit breaker, provider fallback chain, self-correcting LLM output, health monitoring |
| **Claude Code bridge** | Bi-directional sync with `~/.claude/projects/*/memory/MEMORY.md` |
| **Cross-agent MCP** | Standalone MCP server for Cursor, Codex, Gemini CLI, Windsurf, any MCP client |
| **Knowledge graph** | Entity extraction + BFS traversal across files, functions, concepts, errors |
| **4-tier memory** | Working → episodic → semantic → procedural consolidation with strength decay |
| **Team memory** | Namespaced shared + private memory across team members |
| **Governance** | Edit, delete, bulk-delete, and audit trail for all memory operations |
| **Git snapshots** | Version, rollback, and diff memory state via git commits |

### How it compares

| | CLAUDE.md | agentmemory |
|---|---|---|
| Storage | Flat file | iii-engine KV (persistent, distributed) |
| Capture | Manual | All 12 hook types |
| Search | Text find | Hybrid BM25 + vector (6 embedding providers) |
| Intelligence | None | LLM compression, quality scoring, self-correction |
| Memory model | Append-only | Versioned with relationships and evolution |
| Forgetting | Manual delete | Auto-forget (TTL, contradictions, importance) |
| Multi-agent | One file | Shared KV with project-scoped profiles |
| Observability | None | Health monitor, circuit breaker, OTEL telemetry |
| Integration | Built-in | Plugin + MCP server (tools + resources + prompts) + REST API + slash commands |

## Supported Agents

agentmemory works with any agent that supports hooks, MCP, or via its REST API.

### Native hook support (zero config)

These agents support hooks natively. agentmemory captures tool usage automatically via its 12 hooks.

| Agent | Integration | Setup |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code** | 12 hooks (all types) | `/plugin install agentmemory` or manual hook config |
| **Claude Code SDK** | Agent SDK provider | Built-in `AgentSDKProvider` uses your Claude subscription |

### MCP support (any MCP-compatible agent)

Any agent that connects to MCP servers can use agentmemory's 18 tools, 6 resources, and 3 prompts. The agent actively queries and saves memory through MCP calls.

| Agent | How to connect |
|---|---|
| **Claude Desktop** | Add to `claude_desktop_config.json` MCP servers |
| **Cursor** | Add MCP server in settings |
| **Windsurf** | MCP server configuration |
| **Cline / Continue** | MCP server configuration |
| **Any MCP client** | Point to `http://localhost:3111/agentmemory/mcp/*` |

### REST API (any agent, any language)

Agents without hooks or MCP can integrate via 49 REST endpoints directly. This works with any agent, language, or framework.

```bash
POST /agentmemory/observe       # Capture what the agent did
POST /agentmemory/smart-search  # Find relevant memories
POST /agentmemory/context       # Get context for injection
POST /agentmemory/enrich        # Get enriched context (files + memories + bugs)
POST /agentmemory/remember      # Save long-term memory
GET  /agentmemory/profile       # Get project intelligence
```

### Choosing an integration method

| Your situation | Use |
|---|---|
| Claude Code user | Plugin install (hooks + MCP + skills) |
| Building a custom agent with Claude SDK | AgentSDKProvider (zero config) |
| Using Cursor, Windsurf, or any MCP client | MCP server (18 tools + 6 resources + 3 prompts) |
| Building your own agent framework | REST API (49 endpoints) |
| Sharing memory across multiple agents | All agents point to the same iii-engine instance |

## Quick Start

### 1. Install the Plugin (Claude Code)

```bash
/plugin marketplace add rohitg00/agentmemory
/plugin install agentmemory
```

All 12 hooks, 4 skills, and MCP server are registered automatically.

### 2. Start the Worker

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rohitg00/agentmemory.git
cd agentmemory

docker compose up -d       # Start iii-engine
npm install && npm run build && npm start
```

### 3. Verify

```bash
curl http://localhost:3111/agentmemory/health

# Real-time viewer (auto-starts on port 3113)
open http://localhost:3113
```

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "agentmemory",
  "version": "0.4.0",
  "health": {
    "memory": { "heapUsed": 42000000, "heapTotal": 67000000 },
    "cpu": { "percent": 2.1 },
    "eventLoopLagMs": 1.2,
    "status": "healthy"
  },
  "circuitBreaker": { "state": "closed", "failures": 0 }
}
```

### Manual Hook Setup (alternative)

If you prefer not to use the plugin, add hooks directly to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [{ "type": "command", "command": "node ~/agentmemory/dist/hooks/session-start.mjs" }],
    "UserPromptSubmit": [{ "type": "command", "command": "node ~/agentmemory/dist/hooks/prompt-submit.mjs" }],
    "PreToolUse": [{ "type": "command", "command": "node ~/agentmemory/dist/hooks/pre-tool-use.mjs" }],
    "PostToolUse": [{ "type": "command", "command": "node ~/agentmemory/dist/hooks/post-tool-use.mjs" }],
    "PostToolUseFailure": [{ "type": "command", "command": "node ~/agentmemory/dist/hooks/post-tool-failure.mjs" }],
    "PreCompact": [{ "type": "command", "command": "node ~/agentmemory/dist/hooks/pre-compact.mjs" }],
    "SubagentStart": [{ "type": "command", "command": "node ~/agentmemory/dist/hooks/subagent-start.mjs" }],
    "SubagentStop": [{ "type": "command", "command": "node ~/agentmemory/dist/hooks/subagent-stop.mjs" }],
    "Notification": [{ "type": "command", "command": "node ~/agentmemory/dist/hooks/notification.mjs" }],
    "TaskCompleted": [{ "type": "command", "command": "node ~/agentmemory/dist/hooks/task-completed.mjs" }],
    "Stop": [{ "type": "command", "command": "node ~/agentmemory/dist/hooks/stop.mjs" }],
    "SessionEnd": [{ "type": "command", "command": "node ~/agentmemory/dist/hooks/session-end.mjs" }]
  }
}
```

## How It Works

### Observation Pipeline

```
PostToolUse hook fires
  -> Dedup check      SHA-256 hash (5min window, no duplicates)
  -> mem::privacy     Strip secrets, API keys, <private> tags
  -> mem::observe     Store raw observation, push to real-time stream
  -> mem::compress    LLM extracts: type, facts, narrative, concepts, files
                      Validates with Zod, scores quality (0-100)
                      Self-corrects on validation failure (1 retry)
                      Generates vector embedding for semantic search
```

### Context Injection

```
SessionStart hook fires
  -> mem::context     Load recent sessions for this project
                      Hybrid search (BM25 + vector) across observations
                      Inject project profile (top concepts, files, patterns)
                      Apply token budget (default: 2000 tokens)
  -> stdout           Agent receives context in the conversation
```

### What Gets Captured

| Hook | Captures |
|------|----------|
| `SessionStart` | Project path, session ID, working directory |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | User prompts (privacy-filtered) |
| `PreToolUse` | File access patterns + enriched context injection (Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep) |
| `PostToolUse` | Tool name, input, output |
| `PostToolUseFailure` | Failed tool invocations with error context |
| `PreCompact` | Re-injects memory context before context compaction |
| `SubagentStart/Stop` | Sub-agent lifecycle events |
| `Notification` | System notifications |
| `TaskCompleted` | Task completion events |
| `Stop` | Triggers end-of-session summary |
| `SessionEnd` | Marks session complete |

## Search

agentmemory supports hybrid search combining keyword matching with semantic understanding.

### How search works

| Mode | When | How |
|---|---|---|
| **BM25 only** | No embedding API key configured | Keyword matching with BM25 (k1=1.2, b=0.75) |
| **Hybrid** | Any embedding key configured | BM25 + vector cosine similarity fused with Reciprocal Rank Fusion (k=60) |

Hybrid search means "authentication middleware" finds results even if the stored text says "auth layer" or "JWT validation". BM25-only mode still works well for exact keyword matches.

### Embedding providers

agentmemory auto-detects which provider to use from your environment variables. No embedding key? It falls back to BM25-only mode with zero degradation.

| Provider | Model | Dimensions | Env Var | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Gemini | `text-embedding-004` | 768 | `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Free tier (1500 RPM) |
| OpenAI | `text-embedding-3-small` | 1536 | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | $0.02/1M tokens |
| Voyage AI | `voyage-code-3` | 1024 | `VOYAGE_API_KEY` | Optimized for code |
| Cohere | `embed-english-v3.0` | 1024 | `COHERE_API_KEY` | Free trial available |
| OpenRouter | Any embedding model | varies | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | Multi-model proxy |
| Local | `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` | 384 | (none) | Offline, optional `@xenova/transformers` |

Override auto-detection with `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=voyage` in your `.env`.

### Progressive disclosure

Smart search returns compact results first (title, type, score, timestamp) to save tokens. Expand specific IDs to get full observation details.

```bash
# Compact results (50-100 tokens each)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3111/agentmemory/smart-search \
  -d '{"query": "database migration"}'

# Expand specific results (500-1000 tokens each)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3111/agentmemory/smart-search \
  -d '{"expandIds": ["obs_abc123", "obs_def456"]}'
```

## Memory Evolution

Memories in agentmemory are not static. They version, evolve, and form relationships.

### Versioning

When you save a memory that's similar to an existing one (Jaccard > 0.7), the old memory is superseded:

```
v1: "Use Express for API routes"
v2: "Use Fastify instead of Express for API routes" (supersedes v1)
v3: "Use Hono instead of Fastify for Edge API routes" (supersedes v2)
```

Only the latest version is returned in search results. The full chain is preserved for audit.

### Relationships

Memories can be linked: `supersedes`, `extends`, `derives`, `contradicts`, `related`. Each relationship carries a confidence score (0-1) computed from co-occurrence, recency, and relation type. Traversal follows these links up to N hops, with optional `minConfidence` filtering.

### Auto-forget

agentmemory automatically cleans itself:

| Mechanism | What it does |
|---|---|
| **TTL expiry** | Memories with `forgetAfter` date are deleted when expired |
| **Contradiction detection** | Near-duplicate memories (Jaccard > 0.9) — older one is demoted |
| **Low-value eviction** | Observations older than 90 days with importance < 3 are removed |
| **Per-project cap** | Projects are capped at 10,000 observations (lowest importance evicted first) |

Run `POST /agentmemory/auto-forget?dryRun=true` to preview what would be cleaned.

### Project profiles

agentmemory aggregates observations into per-project intelligence:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:3111/agentmemory/profile?project=/my/project"
```

Returns top concepts, most-touched files, coding conventions, common errors, and a session count. This profile is automatically injected into session context.

### Timeline

Navigate observations chronologically around any anchor point:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3111/agentmemory/timeline \
  -d '{"anchor": "2026-02-15", "before": 5, "after": 5}'
```

### Export / Import

Full data portability:

```bash
# Export everything
curl http://localhost:3111/agentmemory/export > backup.json

# Import with merge strategy
curl -X POST http://localhost:3111/agentmemory/import \
  -d '{"exportData": ..., "strategy": "merge"}'
```

Strategies: `merge` (combine), `replace` (overwrite), `skip` (ignore duplicates).

## Self-Evaluation

agentmemory monitors its own health and validates its own output.

### Quality scoring

Every LLM compression is scored 0-100 based on structured facts, narrative quality, concept extraction, title quality, and importance range. Scores are tracked per-function and exposed via `/health`.

### Self-correction

When LLM output fails Zod validation, agentmemory retries with a stricter prompt explaining the exact errors. This recovers from malformed JSON, missing fields, and out-of-range values.

### Circuit breaker + fallback chain

```
Primary provider fails
  -> Circuit breaker opens (3 failures in 60s)
  -> Falls back to next provider in FALLBACK_PROVIDERS chain
  -> 30s cooldown -> half-open -> test call -> recovery
```

Configure with `FALLBACK_PROVIDERS=anthropic,gemini,openrouter`. When all providers are down, observations are stored raw without compression. No data is lost.

### Health monitor

Collects every 30 seconds: heap usage, CPU percentage (delta sampling), event loop lag, connection state. Alerts at warning (80% CPU, 100ms lag) and critical (90% CPU, 500ms lag) thresholds. `GET /agentmemory/health` returns HTTP 503 when critical.

### Standalone MCP Server

Run agentmemory as a standalone MCP server for any MCP-compatible agent (Cursor, Codex, Gemini CLI, Windsurf):

```bash
npx agentmemory-mcp
```

Or add to your agent's MCP config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agentmemory": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["agentmemory-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

The standalone server uses in-memory KV with optional JSON persistence (`STANDALONE_PERSIST_PATH`).

- Knowledge graph visualization
- Health and metrics dashboard

Access at `http://localhost:3113` or via `GET /agentmemory/viewer` on the API port. Protected by `AGENTMEMORY_SECRET` when set. CSP headers applied to all HTML responses.

## Configuration

### LLM Providers

agentmemory needs an LLM for compressing observations and generating summaries. It auto-detects from your environment.

| Provider | Config | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **Claude subscription** (default) | No config needed | Uses `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`. Zero cost beyond your Max/Pro plan |
| **Anthropic API** | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Direct API access, per-token billing |
| **Gemini** | `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Also enables Gemini embeddings (free tier) |
| **OpenRouter** | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | Access any model through one API |

No API key? agentmemory uses your Claude subscription automatically. Zero config.

### Environment Variables
